laser challenge iOS game

Laser Challenge is a puzzle game where you have to destroy a crystal with a laser beam.
The beam can be blocked or deflected by various obstacles present on the screen.
You must use the objects on the board to solve each level.
There are 6 levels to understand the rules in the tutorial.
Then there are 10 free levels of increasing difficulty.
Finally it is possible through an in-app purchase to unlock 25 additional levels which are also increasingly difficult to solve.
